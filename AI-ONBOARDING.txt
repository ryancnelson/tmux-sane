Copy and paste this to any fresh AI coding assistant:

Hello! You're working on **tmux-sane** - a protocol for reliable AI control of tmux sessions.

**Quick start:**

```bash
cd /Volumes/T9/ryan-homedir/devel/tmux-sane
cat BOOTSTRAP.md
```

Follow BOOTSTRAP.md - it will guide you through:
1. Understanding the project (5 min)
2. Checking current state (2 min)
3. Starting your first iteration (30-60 min)

**TL;DR:**
- Read BACKLOG.md
- Pick a Priority 1 item
- Run `./scripts/next-iteration.sh <feature-name>`
- Write tests first, implement, commit
- Keep it to 30-60 minutes

You've got this! 🚀

**That's it!** The agent will bootstrap itself from there.
