# Strategic Review Checklist - tmux-sane

Run this review every 8 iterations to ensure we're building the right thing.

## Part 1: Direction Check (5 min)

**Are we climbing the right hill?**

- [ ] The core value proposition is still valid: "AI agents need reliable tmux control"
- [ ] Recent iterations moved toward user-facing value (not just internal refactoring)
- [ ] We haven't gotten distracted by tangents
- [ ] The pane management approach is proving useful
- [ ] Test-driven development is working well

**Notes:**

## Part 2: Backlog Health (5 min)

**Is the backlog current and useful?**

- [ ] Priority 1 has 5-10 actionable items (30-60 min scope)
- [ ] Priority 2 items are still relevant (haven't become stale)
- [ ] Priority 3 is a reasonable "nice to have" list
- [ ] Ideas Inbox has been reviewed recently
- [ ] Completed section celebrates recent wins

**Actions needed:**
- [ ] Promote items from P2 → P1
- [ ] Demote or delete stale items
- [ ] Break down any items >60 min into smaller pieces
- [ ] Add new ideas that emerged during recent iterations

## Part 3: Code Health (5 min)

**Is technical debt under control?**

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No obvious code duplication
- [ ] Documentation matches implementation
- [ ] Shell scripts follow AGENTS.md style guide
- [ ] New commands use consistent patterns

**Technical debt to address:**

## Part 4: Process Reflection (5 min)

**Is the methodology sustainable?**

- [ ] Iterations consistently taking 30-60 min (not 2+ hours)
- [ ] Tests are fast enough (not blocking iteration flow)
- [ ] Context switching is minimal (one task at a time works)
- [ ] Git history is clean and tells a good story
- [ ] Momentum feels good (not burning out)

**Process improvements:**
